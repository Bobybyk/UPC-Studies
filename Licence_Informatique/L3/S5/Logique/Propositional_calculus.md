Also called **propositional logic**, **statement logic**, **sentential calculus**, **sentential logic**, or sometimes **[zeroth-order logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeroth-order_logic "Zeroth-order logic")**.

## Intro
Deals with **propositions** (can be true or false) and relations between them.

Unlike [[First-order logic]], it does *not* deal with non-logical objects, predicates about them or [quantifiers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantifier_(logic)).
But propositional logic is the foundations for both first-order logic and [[Higher-order logic]] (all the machinery of propositional logic is contained in the other ones).

## Syntax
Propositional logic uses [parse trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concrete_syntax) (link to wikipedia page with drawings).

The formula is represented as a **finite tree**, with operators as branch nodes and propositions as leaf nodes.
They are called *parse trees* because they are often generated by parsing a formula in the "concrete" syntax.

This kind of tree is really easy to manipulate with programming languages and plays well with recursive algorithms.

### Formal definition
The set $P_{0} = \{P, Q, R, ...\}$ is a **finite** set of elements called **proposition symbols**. They are the most basic elements of the language, called **atomic formulas**.

The **logical connectors** form another set $\omega = \{\neg, \wedge, \vee, \Rightarrow, \Leftrightarrow\}$.

A propositional formula is $\varphi = P \in P_{0} \mid \neg\varphi \mid \varphi\vee\varphi \mid \varphi\wedge\varphi$.

## Interpretation
(FR : Semantique)

Notation : $[[\varphi]]^{[I]}$

An **interpretation** is a function $I : P_{0} \mapsto \mathbb{B}$ that assigns a value $\{\mathbb{0}, \mathbb{1}\}$ to a formula $\varphi$.
A **partial interpretation** can be used to only assign values to some of the proposition symbols.

Notation for the partial interpretation that assign $\mathbb{1}$ to $P$ and $\mathbb{0}$ to $Q$ :
$[[P \wedge \neg Q]]^{[\mathbb{1}/P, \mathbb{0}/Q]}$

## Satisfiability

If the formula $\varphi$ is true under the interpretation $I$, then $I$ is a **model** for $\varphi$ : $I$ **satisfies** $\varphi$ : we write $I \models \varphi$.
